Intro:

    This program is use to demonstrate the operation overloading. Here are the 
operators that the program had written, +, -, *, /, ++, --, >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, 
>>, <<.

    There are some functions that are also written in the program. The function 
Evaluate() is to evaluate the numbers into double type, function ToFraction() is 
to change the mixed number into improper fraction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use this program:

First, you'll just have to type "make" in command, then the makefile will make 
a execution file called "main". Then you can execute the main program. In main, 
the program will demonstrate some operation overloading first, the you can choose
the mode you want. There are two modes, insert and quit. If you want to insert your 
own mixed number, then type "insert", the program will go into insert mode. After 
insert two mixed numbers, the rogram will show every operation. If you want to 
quit the program, just enter "quit", the program will terminate.
