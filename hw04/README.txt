Intro:

This program is use to determine the convex hull. The program will read the file
called "test.txt", then use two method to seperate points into two part, one is 
edge points of convex hull, and another are points in convex hull.

Two methods are "Brute Force" and "Jarvis March". Then each algorithm has its 
own output file. 

After executing each algorithm, the program will show the time cost, to show the
efficiency of the method.

In "Brute Force", I decided to sort the edge points by selection sort. And the 
order of sorted points are in clockwise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use this program:

First, if you are reading this file, then you should have already unzipped the
.tar.bz2 file. There is a executable file called "main", you'll just have to enter the 
command "./main" and then the program will read the "test.txt" file and output.
