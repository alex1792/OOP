Intro:

    As we know there are different kind of shapes in real world, such as "circle",
"triangle" etc. They are all kind of shape. So this program is to show that these
different shape in the base class "Shape" and some different derived class "Circle",
"Rectangle", "Triangle".

    The derived classes inherit the base class's public functions. What we save in 
base classes are their colors, then we save different data in derived classes. Derived
classes can have their own print() and can also call the print() of base class. 
That is called the virtual method. Pure method is that base class doesn't do any
thing, just pass it to the derived class, and write the details in derived class.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use this program:

First, you'll just have to type "make" in command, then the makefile will make 
a execution file called "main". Then you can execute the main program. In main, 
the program will demonstrate different shpaes and then print all of them and by
shapes. If there the shape is legal, then will print out the message behind its
data. If it's correct, the will print out "color" "shape" "data" "area".
